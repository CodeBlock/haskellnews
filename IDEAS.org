All streams should support adding items manually.

* DONE Reddit

** DONE The Haskell reddit
** The Haskell proposals reddit (?) â€” NO. Not relevant anymore.
** DONE Proggit with the word 'Haskell'/'GHC' and such in it

* TODO Mailing lists

- Haskell-Cafe
- Haskell
- iPhone/Web/etc.

* TODO Blogs

So we can start with Planet Haskell:

http://planet.haskell.org/

But these blogs also contain personal posts which are unrelated to
Haskell, so there should be a way to filter and mark those.

* DONE Vimeo channels
** DONE Vimeo Haskell channel
** DONE Galois

The site is here: http://vimeo.com/channels/galois/videos/rss

* TODO YouTube channels

This seems hard, there's no RSS feed for it.

There's a list that was posted recently, created by Chris Smith.

* The IRC channels

Some well-known channels:

- #haskell
- #haskell-lens
- #yesod
- #snap
- #happs

* DONE Twitter

- Haskell-related tweets from Twitter with a tag.

* TODO Google+

Seems hard, like YouTube. Google suck at providing RSS feeds for anything.

- Haskell community posts.
- Posts related to Haskell with a tag.

* Hackage

- New hackage packages and updates.

* Github repositories

- Any new ones created with Haskell as the main language.
- New versions pushed.

* Hpaste

Maybe.

* HaskellWiki

Can show latest changes.

* Events

Can be taken from various places and inputted manually.
* Job listings
